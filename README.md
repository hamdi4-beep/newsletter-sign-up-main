## My process

After I analyzed the project's requirements, I wrote down a list of potential challenges I need to consider so I can start the project with a good idea of what tools and technologies are required.

I also set up the project with Vite to get everything running as quickly as possible.

Here's a list of steps I followed to get the process up and running:

1. Initialized a repo in Github.
2. Installed necessary dependancies such as Sass, react-router.
3. Created a folder structure for the components and sass files.
4. Created the component files starting with parent components.
5. Tested the project in the browser to make sure that everything's working properly.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TypeScript]

### What I learned

I learned that you don't particularly have to set up 'private routing'. Once the project is deployed, you won't be able to access other routes unless they're navigated through the app.

### Continued development

I'm still not comfortable with naming big components and dividing responsibilities. I wish I could've organized the Sass files well and avoided running into conflicts. I need to look more into CSS frameworks to avoid having to deal with these issues.
